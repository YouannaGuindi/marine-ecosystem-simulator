# Marine Ecosystem Simulator

## Description
Object-oriented Java project simulating a marine ecosystem and the interactions between marine organisms, environmental conditions, and human-induced threats.

## Project Structure
- `src/ecosystem/` : Java source code implementing the object-oriented model
- `data/` : Configuration and data files used by the simulation

## Main Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Modeling of dynamic systems
- Simulation of environmental and human impacts
- Monitoring and detection of ecosystem imbalance

## Key Component
- **Tracker**: responsible for monitoring ecosystem parameters and triggering alerts whenever an imbalance or critical threshold is detected.

## Technologies
- Language: Java
- Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming

## Context
Academic project carried out at **AASTMT (Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport)** in semester 3./
